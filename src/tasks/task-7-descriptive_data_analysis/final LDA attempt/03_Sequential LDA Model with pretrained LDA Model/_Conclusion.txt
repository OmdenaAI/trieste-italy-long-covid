LDASeq model with pretrained LDAModel (reproducible model).								
--Topic model is available in *6 topics* text file.
--Topic analysis available in *seq_pretrain reprod* sheet of Excel file.

--Conclusion: Topics seem jumbled and difficult to interpret. If one goes through the word mix in each topic generated by the sequential LDA model, although there are diverse words in many topics, each topic is not coherent in itself. 								
--Thus, it would seem that LDASeq with pretrained LdaModel, although it is an advanced approach, is not always reliable depending on the nature of your corpus.
