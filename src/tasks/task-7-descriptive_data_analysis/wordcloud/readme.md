<b>Experiments on wordcloud generation and extraction of keywords.</b>
- definition of  an italian stopword list (644 words). This is extended with more custom words, inside the notebooks
- notebooks to generate wordcloud and extract keywords from batches of tweets:
-   generate_word_cloud_from_tweets.ipynb (generation from text (i.e. token frequency on the whole text made by the concatenation of (cleaned tweets)))
-   generate_wordclouds_extract_keywords.ipynb (contains the code of the previous nb plus code to generate wordcloud and extraxt keywords with the TF-IDF method and also to extract keywords with the RAKE method)
- analysis on time windows: half-year analysis and quarterly analysis
